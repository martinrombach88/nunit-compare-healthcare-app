1. Before beginning nunit, study repository pattern.

What is repository pattern?

Find a book chapter that includes repository pattern

Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (Martin Fowler et al) 315
Overview -> separate querying from database layers. Use the repository 
as a separation between querying clients and databases so that
databases are not directly contacted by clients.

In Csharp
Controller - Repository - Data Context - Database

You should definitely attempt implementation before NUnit.
