Tech:

Build a prototype of the core product -> the comparison site.

Frontend - mobile app is best (next.js web app desirable)
Keep it simple! -> just the product, don't get bogged down in the promotion,
this is a backend technology exploration first and foremost

Backend - csharp API with desired tech to explore
API on Azure -> can you make it free tier with an App Service?
200 entries, one for each country. API can be public to cut costs.

Build the API using best practices: 
csharp (rider)
demonstrations of SOLID
repository pattern 
nunit 100% testing coverage 
users?

What further concepts could you add? 
Maybe its better to explore more complicated data concepts in another project?
(there's more to data structures than APIs, e.g. text adventure)

BD roadmap?
