Example:
/health-systems/{country} for individual details.
/health-systems/compare?country1=britain&country2=south-korea for comparisons.
response:
{
  "country1": {
    "name": "Britain",
    "healthSystemDetails": { ... }
  },
  "country2": {
    "name": "South Korea",
    "healthSystemDetails": { ... }
  },
  "comparison": {
    "betterHealthSystem": "South Korea",
    "reasons": [ ... ]
  }
}

Scalability:
Depending on the complexity of the comparison logic, 
it might be better to offload this computation to a backend service or
 even a separate microservice.

This microservice can just be a console app or something as a separate folder 
to the API. This could be an opportunity to explore OOP and SOLID than the API.
But then again, so could remaining in the api. Keep it mocked and it should be fine.
