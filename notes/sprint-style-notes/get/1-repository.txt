Type naming guidelines (type arguments like function(T item) are a good move in a generic method or constructor

Country Controller talks to Country Repository, which declares repository. 
Repository declares data context during construction.

2. GetOne
3. GetComparisonResult
- how do you follow solid with this? brainstorm before implementation
comparison result takes two items and
a result class constructor function, returns the result class

Result:
1 Get all uses the generic repository
2 Get one uses a custom repository due to the comparison based on field names.
(feels like you could solve this somehow)
3 Get comparison result is an api 'client-side' that makes results based on database output.
Database should remain ignorant and just continue to send get one.
