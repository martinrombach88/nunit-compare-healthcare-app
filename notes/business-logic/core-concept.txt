Business / Charity goal:
A country healthcare comparison site to campaign for regulated, low price,
 semi-privatised healthcare in the UK and across the world.

Full stack website with a data driven API?
What does data driven mean?

Interactive Page: Search a country, compare it to yours. Overview shows you if its better or worse.
(sounds like this is the fundamental product here)

- Proposal page to make improvements?


Page: Running a blog that includes regular stories related to the topic. (Optional Extra)
Sounds like a simple react page, but do you want to host?  

UK 
- free but huge tax burden leads to circle of dismantling and rebuilding by right wing and left wing parties
- experiences in south korea make me think nhs should no longer be free, but cheap
- free healthcare in the UK subsidized to businesses has become exploitation of the tax payer rather than 
fair market economics in action, low quality for business profit etc
- fear of the american system leads to UK citizens desperate to keep the NHS as it is, which misses the point, 
the US isn't only the country in the world but it feels like the only one we hear about

South Korea successfully executes a system where centralised taxation occurs but 
healthcare is part paid by the customer. Its ranked second in the world.
- experience makes me want to see if UK could potentially have a referendum
on how the NHS is funded.

Splitting the bill with the rich
- the rich are paying for a system they don't use
- therefore feel empowered to avoid paying for it with tax avoidance, lobbying, defunding, target based approaches
when tories in power) 
- if you split the bill, everyone who uses it is 'responsible' and doing their bit. Private prices go down, quality goes up.
50 50 split seems to fit the UK philosophy
50% recovery of NHS funding could not only repair the healthcare system but
funding could buy back trains and power companies :D
...getting ahead of yourself?

NHS Referendum -> what projects could come out of pursuing this?
- chatbots that explain your ideas, accurately answers questions, debates well
- calculation applications that explore the financial predictions (data science?)
could you run a data analysis project on the success/failure of your proposed referendum?
how would you do that?

How do you quantify that?
- Waiting list lengths
- A and E waiting times in hours
- customer satisfaction
- world ranking

In the context of the portfolio / job hunt:
Build a prototype of the core product -> the comparison site.

Backend - csharp API with desired tech to explore
API on Azure -> can you make it free tier with an App Service?
200 entries, one for each country. API can be public to cut costs.

-- optional --
Frontend - mobile app is best (next.js web app desirable)
Keep it simple! -> just the product, don't get bogged down in the promotion.

this is a backend technology exploration first and foremost

Once you have the prototype app, you can use it during campaigning to
show during networking.
