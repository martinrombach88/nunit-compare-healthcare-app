Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");

//while not exit
//ask: welcome to the comparison console app
//insert country 1
//insert country 2

//return sentences explaining winner and results
//e.g country 1 has a better healthcare system.
//country 1 is ranked x higher than country 2.
//It has x months shorter waiting lists.
//It takes x hours less to see a doctor in A & E.
//Maybe country 2 could learn something from country 1.

//Finance split examples
//Country 1 has a finance split of x% tax and x% cash paid by the customer.
//If either 0 then 
//Whereas Country 2 finances by putting 100% of the burden on the taxpayer / customer.

//Shared tax/cash burden as a focal point? Can you make it a method of the console app?
